Setup is easy just run `script/bootstrap` to install all the symlink files.

No real requirements that I know of outside the basics, I as I get this on more machines more and more of the files become modularized so yay!

## Thanks

- @caarlos0, lots of the original zshrc and bashrc are inspired by his dotfiles along with bootstrap.
- @tomlazar, he is great!
