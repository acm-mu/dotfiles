# tomlazars dotfiles

![Powered by Antibody][ab]


This is my personal set of dotfile customizations. Designed to be able to run on any of my servers no matter the distro or installed applications.

Setup is easy just run `script/bootstrap` to install all the symlink files.

No real requirements that I know of outside the basics, I as I get this on more machines more and more of the files become modularized so yay!

## Thanks

- @caarlos0, lots of the original zshrc and bashrc are inspired by his dotfiles along with bootstrap.
